  An example of a static website is the Lehman 
  <ul><a href="http://japanese-lehman.info/#">Japanese department</a></il> website. It looks 
  like it's mostly maybe up of html. It's not retaining any info to 
  an external space like a database. What I like about it is it's pretty simple 
  but looks nice and it's kind of mobile friendly. Also the layout is good. What I don't like 
  about it is everything is on the same page but on the plus side is the links at the top 
  takes you to each section.

  An example of a Dynamic website is this Lash website called 
  <ul><a href="https://www.doelashes.com/">Doe Lashes</a></il>. I really enjoy the 
  color palette of the website and how complex it is but it's very organize. I find it very 
  interactive too, like its logo in the home screen and the pop ups for subscription. Which is what makes it dynamic 
  since it's a website to shop, you know there's a database where they can pull stock quantity, email subscriptions, 
  and etc.
